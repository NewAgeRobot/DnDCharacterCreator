## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Open 5E API

This uses a mix of it all really, really leaning hard on javascript to save the data into localstorage and then pull it out again when needed or updated. It uses the Open 5E Api as the official WoTC DND5E API has a lot to pull but seems incredibly geared towards the like of discord bots or people pulling in entire rulesets. It lacks basic things like class and race descriptions and also has the limitation of only working with the SRD.

## Optimizations

Halfway through the project I decided to switch from the DND5E API to the Open 5E API and it became a lot easier to work with. The Open 5E API immediately generates a ton of information and has it organised incredibly well. I am working on adding profile images, incorporating sliding panels to access inventory and spell tracking.

## Lessons Learned:

It was great to get through the ins and outs of a local storage based project, it provides such great utility to handle large datasets in memory and the ability to have a persistent character sheet that can be easily updated has already been incredibly useful for my tables as we work off of tablets.
